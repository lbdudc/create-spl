## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - :tada: `:tada:` for initial commits
  - :bug: `:bug:` for bug fixes
  - :memo: `:memo:` for documentation
  - :sparkles: `:sparkles:` for new features

### Coding Standards

- Follow Create SPL's coding conventions and guidelines.
- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Ensure all tests pass.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

- **bug**: Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs.
- **duplicate**: Issues or pull requests that are duplicates of other issues or pull requests.
- **enhancement**: Feature requests.
- **good first issue**: Issues that should be relatively straightforward to address and are a good place to start for newcomers.
- **help wanted**: Issues that should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` ones.

We use other labels to help us organize and prioritize issues and pull requests. Feel free to suggest new labels or changes to existing ones.

Thank you for contributing to Create Spl!
